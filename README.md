# **Master Thesis Repo about LiDAR Pointcloud Interpolations using Neural Networks.**

Author: Nicolás Salomón - email: nicolassalomon96@gmail.com

The repo is organized as follow:

**Classification_networs folder:**
It contains all the files related to pointcloud object detection and classification networks, such as Pointpillars or Complex YOLO

**Interpolation_networks folder:**
It contains all the files related to pointcloud interpolation networks. Not only public and State of the Art techniques, but also the proposed one.

**KITTI_Evaluation_Tool folder:**
It contains all the files related to KITTI Evaluation criteria, available on KITTI Official Website

**Utils folder:**
It contains some useful files and notebook used during the writing of the Thesis.

**IMPORTANT:** Pointpillars trained models are private and need to ask for permission in order to see them
